# SnakeGame
The classic Snake Game created using only HTML, CSS, and JS. The speed of the snake and the snake expansion rate can be changed by simply changing the value of either the snakeSpeed or expansionRate variables in the game.js file. AlertifyJS is used for the confirm screen upon game ending. Sound effects are also incorporated when eating food and when the game is over.
