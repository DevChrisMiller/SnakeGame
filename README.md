# SnakeGame
The classic Snake Game created only using HTML, CSS, and JS. The speed of the snake and the snake expansion rate can be changed by simply changing the value of either the snakeSpeed or expansionRate variables in the game.js file. Sound effects are also incorporated when eating food and when the game is over.
